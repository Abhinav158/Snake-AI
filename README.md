# Snake-AI

This is my very first Reinforcement Learning Project. <br>
To create a model using Q Learning, one of the well known techniques under Reinforcement Learning, that would play the popular "Snake Game" and ultimately, complete the game. The same method can be used for various other applications like autonomous car driving or an engine for a game like chess.
