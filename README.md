# Snake-AI

This is my very first Reinforcement Learning Project. <br>
To create a model using Q Learning, one of the well known techniques under Reinforcement Learning, that would play the popular "Snake Game" and ultimately, complete the game.
<br> <h2> How to play the Game: </h2> 
1. The Snake needs to be directed towards the food (depicted by a red dot) which spawns randomly on the game board. <br>
2. Everytime you eat the food, another one is spawned in a random location and the size of the snake increases. The score is also incremented by 1. <br>
3. Now, you have to direct the snake to eat the food spawned at the new location <br>
4. The game comes to an end when <br>
 <ul>
  <li> the snake hits any of the borders of the game window ; or </li>
  <li> (b) the snake bombards itself </li>
  </ul>
  
5. The game is completed when there are no free grids left on the game board. 


<br>The same method of learning used in the above project can be used for various other applications like autonomous car driving or an engine for a game like chess.
